## Dependencies

# JSON Server Project

This project utilizes JSON Server to create a mock RESTful API based on a JSON file. JSON Server is a lightweight tool that allows you to quickly set up a backend server for prototyping, development, or testing purposes.

# Usage
With the JSON Server running, you can make HTTP requests to the available API endpoints using tools like fetch in JavaScript or API testing tools like Postman.

Make sure to update your frontend application or code to use the appropriate API endpoints for fetching and manipulating data.
